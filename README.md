# CS:GO Personal Configs

These are my personal configs for CSGO in game and for practice.

There is nothing special, I just want to prevent to cases needing a backup.

Cheers.

## `autoexec.cfg`

You can't auto exec, the name is a community standard.

Locate the folder:
```
<Your computer location for Steam>/userdata/<your-user-id>/730/local/config/
```

Place the file `autoexec.cfg` with the name of your choice.

In the in game console type:

```
exec autoexec
````

Note: `autoexec` is the name of the file. If you change it, you will execute as `exec <name-you-choosed>`

## `practice.cfg`

You may load it in game just as `autoexec.cfg` or use it as resource for copy/pasting during practice.
